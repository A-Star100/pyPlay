# pyPlay
A simple Python video player app.

This project is just so people can play video with Python, and **will not** be properly maintained, as it is a side project. If you're looking for a more advanced, cross-platform video player (that doesn't use Python), check out [SimpliPlay](https://simpliplay.netlify.app), also created by me, which supports HLS and MPEG-DASH on *every* platform except iOS.

## Requirements
Python 3.6 or later
PyQT (version to install in requirements.txt)

## After cloning the repo
Simply type 

`pip install reqiurements.txt`

inside the source code directory, then type

`python3 pyPlay.py`

and you should see a window with options to play, pause, stop, go fullscreen, scrub through progress (progress slider is buggy, be careful!), a URL input dialog and a choose file button. Use these however you would like :D
